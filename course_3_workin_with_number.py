"""working with numbers"""

#from math import * # Communly used to do advanced maths functions

# I watch this course : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&t=52s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

print(2) # It prints the number I wrote could be also a decimal number as 2.22208 for exemple
print(-2) # It can also print negative numbers

## Basic maths
print(7.8 + 2.2) # You can do basic operations like that.
print(7.8 - 2.2) # You can do basic soustractions like that.
print(7.8 / 2.2) # You can do basic divisions like that.
print(7.8 * 2.2) # You can do basic multiplications like that.

## Complex maths
print((7.8 + 2.2) * 3) # You can add parenthesis like that in order to change the order of the multiplication

# You can store numbers in variables

my_num = -5

print(my_num * 2) #Used the variable to do maths
print(str(my_num)) # Turns the number into a string
print(str(my_num)+ " my favorite number") # So you can add a number in a string because otherwise you can't

## TODO using maths functions

print(abs(my_num)) # Gives the absolute number of my variable
print(pow(3, 2)) # Gives power to the first number with the second eg. 3^2 une puissance 3 puissance 2
print(max(3, 6)) # Gives the bigger number of the function
print(min(3, 6)) # Just do the opposite of above
print(round(4.9)) # Rounds a number following the basics rules
