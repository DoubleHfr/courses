""" What's tuples"""

# I watch this course : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&t=52s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

# Tuples are containers where you can store differents values
## Same as a list but a tuple is UNMUTABLE it can't be changed

## TODO How to create a Tuple ? 

coordinates = (4, 5) # This is a tuple because of the parenthesis
coordinates_2 = [4,5] # This is a list because of the square brackets

## But you can create a list of tuples 

coordinates_list = [(4, 5), (5, 7), (10, 8)] # Just as this !
