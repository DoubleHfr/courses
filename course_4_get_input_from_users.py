#input("Enter your name") # Added a prompt to the line above !

## TODO Write a basic program where the user enters his name and the computer says Hi !

#name = input("Enter your name ! :") # Stock the input in a variable called name 
#print("Hi " + name + "!") #Prints the name given by the user plus an "!"

## TODO Complexify
name = input("Enter your name ! :") # Stock the input in a variable called name 
age = input("Enter your age ! :") # Stock the input in a variable called name
